Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming. They define how data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a program. Understanding data structures is very important for developing efficient and effective algorithms. In this tutorial, we will explore the most commonly used data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

2.What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

Classification of Data Structure:

Classification of Data Structure

↘️Linear Data Structure: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. Example: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.

↘️Static Data Structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. Example: array.

↘️Dynamic Data Structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. Example: Queue, Stack, etc.

↘️Non-Linear Data Structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only.Examples: Trees and Graphs.

🤖What is an Array?
An array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations. It’s one of the most popular and simple data structures and is often used to implement other data structures. Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0 . Each element in an array is accessed through its index.

Need of Array Data Structures
Arrays are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They are used in a wide variety of applications, including:
Storing data for processing
Implementing data structures such as stacks and queues
Representing data in tables and matrices
Creating dynamic data structures such as linked lists and trees

Types of Array
There are two main types of arrays:
One-dimensional arrays: These arrays store a single row of elements.
Multidimensional arrays: These arrays store multiple rows of elements.
Array Operations
Common operations performed on arrays include:

Traversal : Visiting each element of an array in a specific order (e.g., sequential, reverse).
Insertion : Adding a new element to an array at a specific index.
Deletion : Removing an element from an array at a specific index.
Searching : Finding the index of an element in an array.
Applications of Array
Arrays are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

Storing data for processing
Implementing data structures such as stacks and queues
Representing data in tables and matrices
Creating dynamic data structures such as linked lists and trees
