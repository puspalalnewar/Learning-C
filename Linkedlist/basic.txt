Definition of LinkedList:
A Linked List is a data structure used for storing a collection of elements. Unlike arrays, the elements in a linked list are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (or node) consists of a data part and a reference (or pointer) to the next element in the sequence.

Structure of a Linked List Node-------------->
Data: Stores the actual value of the node.
Pointer (Next): Points to the next node in the sequence.
A typical singly linked list node in C might be defined as:


struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};


Types of Linked Lists----------------------->
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node, and the last node points to NULL.
Doubly Linked List: Each node has two pointers, one pointing to the next node and one pointing to the previous node.
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
Examples
1. Singly Linked List
Diagram:
[1 | next] -> [2 | next] -> [3 | next] -> NULL

Operations:--------------------->
Insertion: Adding a new node.
Deletion: Removing an existing node.
Traversal: Visiting each node in the list.
2. Doubly Linked List Diagram:
NULL <- [1 | prev | next] <-> [2 | prev | next] <-> [3 | prev | next] -> NULL

Operations:--------------------->
Similar to a singly linked list but with additional complexity in handling the prev pointer.
Advantages of Linked Lists
Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require a fixed size. They can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting a node does not require shifting elements, as is necessary with arrays. This makes these operations efficient, especially in the middle of the list.
No Wasted Space: Memory is allocated only when needed, unlike arrays which might allocate more space than required.
Disadvantages of Linked Lists
Memory Overhead: Each node requires extra memory for the pointer(s), which can add up when there are many nodes.
Slower Access Time: Accessing elements is slower compared to arrays because you must traverse the list from the beginning to find a specific element.
Complexity: Linked lists are more complex to implement and manage, especially when dealing with operations like reversing the list, merging lists, etc.
Cache Unfriendliness: Since linked list elements are not stored contiguously, accessing elements may lead to more cache misses compared to arrays.
Applications of Linked Lists
Implementing other data structures: Like stacks, queues, and graphs.
Memory management: Linked lists can be used in memory allocation routines.
Undo functionality: For applications like text editors where actions can be undone.
Linked lists provide flexibility in managing collections of data, but their efficiency depends on the specific use case and operations required.
